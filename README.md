# Hi, I'm FlacSy 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm here to share my experience in Python development as well as my projects related to aiogram and disnake frameworks. I'm currently learning how to develop libraries.

## Experience

- 🐍 I am an ordinary Python developer.
- 💬 I actively use disnake to create bots in Discord.
- 🐦 I am also familiar with aiogram, a framework for creating bots in Telegram.

## Projects

Here you will find my projects related to Python, aiogram and disnake:

1. [BDW](https://github.com/FlacSy/bdw) - This library is needed to check text for obscene words in different languages. To check for plagiarism and keywords.
2. [CJM Bot](https://github.com/FlacSy/CJM-Bot) - CJM Bot is a Discord bot written using the disnake library.
